# officeDataSetAnalysis

In this project i have performed few operations on the dataset mentioned below and clustered the plot using two fields age and salary to analyse which age group employees having how muvh salary
•	Showing the basic details of employees such as number of employees, number of states, number of departments.
•	Can classify and produce how many employees from each state and number of employees in each separate department
•	Finding the minimum and maximum salaries in each department and sort salaries in ascending order
•	Printing the count of employees working under a state and printing an employee from a specified department.
•	Raising the salaries of employees whose age is greater than 45
•	Filtering out the employees from the specified state and filtering the employees from particular age then increasing the bonus of the employees
•	Summarizing all elements in dataset by showing the mean, min, max and count of all fields present in the dataset such as descriptive statistics of the given data.
•	Analysing the fields selected by printing the cluster using k map algorithm
    o	  Here we have selected cluster count as 5 because,
    o	Here the fields selected were age and salary and by observing the plot before clustering all the age groups were covered in all types of salaries like low salaries and high salaries so to cover all the age groups, we have selected 5 different clusters which is also used to classify different groups and can be easy to select the people from the clustered plot.
•	 By analysing the final cluster which was formed by the k means their organization can easily sort out which age group employee need to be selected and the below array represents the age which was selected by the cluster algorithm and the right side value represents the salary of the employee
